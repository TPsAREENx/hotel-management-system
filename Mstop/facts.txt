This tool is designed to help you quit "Mast*rbation"

P*rn can cause many health problems including
Premature ejacul*tion, Er*ctyle dysfunction, etc.
When you are addicted to p*rn you have the urge to 
m*sturbate everyday, Your brain has a reward system
which rewards you when you have s*x, M*sturbating
with P*rn hijacks the reward system and releases
Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin which causes your brain
to change physically, your brain rewires itself to 
accommodate the extra chemicals, you build up a 
tolerance and a dependency to the chemicals. You go
from "wanting" the pleasure chemicals in order to 
feel good, to "needing" them. Aggressive & regular
m*sturbation may cause prostate cancer or increase the
risk of the same.

Most people start m*sturbating again after stopping for
a maximum of 4-5 days. This tool is specificaly designed
to help you quit P*rn.
