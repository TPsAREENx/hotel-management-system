BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE MAKE SURE TO:-
1. Install all the necessary Modules.
  *pip install datetime
  *pip install prettytable
  *pip install time
  *pip install mysql-connector-python

2. Install MySQL server.
3. Keep the commands.txt in the same folder with project code. (#if python is unable to find 'commands.txt' then specify absolute path.)
4. set 'sqlpass' to your MySQL password.
5. MySQL server should be connected and running.

In commands.txt change the insert values of all tables.
Preference: Run it in vscode for best experience.

That's it.
Now the code should work fine.
